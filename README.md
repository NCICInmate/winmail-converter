# Winmail.dat-Converter
This is a small web application to extract attachments from winmail.dat files (which are sometimes sent by Outlook).

## Installation and Requirements
You will need PHP >= 7.0 as well as the php-zip extension. You must also install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

Then you can run `composer install` and you're set.

Use any webserver you like. For testing purposes you can do `php -S localhost:8000` and then visit http://localhost:8000/.
